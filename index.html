Moreover, the Muslim population strongly condemns theft and thuggery, considering them as &lsquo;haram&rsquo; or forbidden acts. Nonetheless, it is advisable to exercise general safety precautions while in Malindi, such as refraining from walking at night and keeping your valuables securely with you. If you&rsquo;re traveling with children, it&rsquo;s best to limit their exposure to public <strong>Malindi beaches</strong> during peak hours (when <strong>Malindi beach boys</strong> are most active) and keep them close to you at all times. Additionally, it&rsquo;s advantageous to book with reputable <strong>Malindi hotels</strong> and <strong>Malindi tour operators</strong> to ensure a safe and enjoyable stay in Mombasa. Finally, take precautionary steps such as avoiding carrying large sums of cash around (opt for an international credit card and Mpesa instead) and storing valuables securely in your hotel room or <strong>Malindi rental car</strong>. On request we can offer you a Mpesa line
